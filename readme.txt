WHAT IS SILVER?:
	It's essentially a modpack of a few different mods and some new content. It adds some new scenes, a map, scene changes, potions, custom outfits and evolving outfits. At the moment it is in a very unstable beta state with new content and bug fixes being added weekly.
	▪ Cheats are in the closet

SHOULD I DOWNLOAD THIS OR THE RUSSIAN VERSION?:
	That is completely a personal choice. The Russian version is almost certainly a more complete product than silver. At the present point in time I would recommend the Russian version over silver if you want a complete play through. If you want to do some bug testing or just see the new content and already have BT then download silver.
