WHAT IS SILVER?:
	It's essentially a modpack of a few different mods and some new content. It adds some new scenes, a map, scene changes, potions, custom outfits and evolving outfits. At the moment it is in a very unstable beta state with new content and bug fixes being added weekly.
	▪	Cheats are in the closet

SHOULD I DOWNLOAD THIS OR THE RUSSIAN VERSION?:
	That is completely a personal choice. The Russian version is almost certainly a more complete product than silver. At the present point in time I would recommend the Russian version over silver if you want a complete play through. If you want to do some bug testing or just see the new content and already have BT then download silver.

CONTENT CHANGES THIS PATCH (22/12/2015):
	▪	Bug Fixes (See below - // means fixed)
	▪	Costumes can now be worn during specific private favours assuming you own them
	▪	Cheats now work
BALANCE CHANGES THIS PATCH:
	▪	Snape now has very little HP during the duel (Will die in one hit)
KNOWN BUGS:
	▪	//Cat tail goes in front of certain outfits instead of behind (long skirts and jeans)
	▪	Outfits change mid scenes (when whoring goes up)
	▪	Fawkes still has the issue of acting as if you've already spoken the first time you click on her
	▪	Late texture pop ins for Hermione torso after conversations
	▪	Hermione references cat potion but I haven't done that yet
	▪	Hermione's breasts go past her clothes when transparent (With certain clothes)
	▪	//"Wear your hair up" changes her hair from red to brown (No updo for red hair atm)
	▪	//Dying hair always makes it so she's no longer wearing it up
	▪	Hermione's initial reaction to panty thief occurs multiple times
	▪	Dialogue doesn't match up with if Hermione isn't wearing a shirt/skirt
	▪	Hair changes back to default hair during UE tutoring 
	▪	//Too many arms during certain favours
WRITTEN CONTENT NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:
	▪	Collar scenes
	▪	Tentacle scenes
	▪	Public shaming
	▪	Cat bug's expansion scene
	▪	Luna Polyjuice potion (Chibis required)
UNWRITTEN CONTENT THAT'S PLANNED:
	▪	Levels for the potions (like private favours)
WHAT WAS DONE THIS WEEK:
	▪	Breast Expansion potion
	▪	Costume role-play scenes
	▪	Writing Polyjuice potion
	▪	Clothes store GUI
PLAN FOR NEXT WEEK:
	▪	More role-play scenes
	▪	Lamia potion
	▪	Public shaming
SUGGESTIONS:
	▪	Edit books so that each chapter is twice as long, and there are only half as many.
	▪	I really love the idea of Hermione's "default" clothes getting skimpier and skimpier over time. If you possibly included a scene where genie comments on it, I think it would be great
	▪	When having sex, it doesn't really make sense or Hermione to say "let me take my panties off"
	▪	3rd anal scene changes based around (“No, ‘Whore’ is good. Call me that, [name].”)
	▪	Time period between the first and second time Hermione is too long
	▪	Hermione seems way too immediately willing to change clothes/hair
	▪	Ability to quick continue books
	▪	Extend the Butt Molester scene
